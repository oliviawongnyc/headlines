## About Headlines

This game is a personal, hobby project and not affiliated with the New York
Times.

Headlines is a game where users complete noteworthy NYT headlines using the
publish date and answer bank as clues. The app uses
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) components and
[@dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) for drag and drop. There is a
[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database.

You can find the deployed application
[here](https://headlines-oliviawongnyc.vercel.app/).
